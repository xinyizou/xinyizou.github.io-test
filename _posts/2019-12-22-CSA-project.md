I recently got the chance to present the work I had been doing at the Canadian Space Agency internally an intern poster session. It was such a great opportunity to learn about the work being done around the CSA and to share what I had been working on the past few months.

I'm happy to have placed 2nd in the intern pitch competition and 3rd in the poster competition for my project (out of about 20 students). My project primarily dealt with processing the Alouette I satellite's data and building an application to make its data easy to access. Forunately, since none of the details of my project involve restricted information, I have permission to share my poster detailing my work! The poster is below.
